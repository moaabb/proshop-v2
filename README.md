# Proshop V2 with Golang Backend

Kind of a fork of the (ProshopV2)[https://github.com/bradtraversy/proshop-v2] of Traversy Media.

Here i am using his frontend and recreating the backend using Go.

The goal here (not funny) is to create all the features that alreay exist in the original project and after that will be a playground for me to add new technologies that i want to apply in a small size project. I am doing this using a microservices approach.

## Technologies so far

- GO
- Gin Gonic
- PostgreSQL
- Kong
- Tilt for dev
- Docker

<br>

## In the future i want to add:

- gRPC -> Communication between microservices
- RabbitMQ with asynchronous requests
